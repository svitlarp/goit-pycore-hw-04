## Python Tasks: 

### 1) Processing and analysis of data contained in text files:
* Task1: Implement a function total_salary(path) that parses a text file and returns the total and average salary of all developers.
  Each line in the file contains the developer's last name and salary, separated by a comma with no spaces.
* Task2: Implement a function get_cats_info(path) that parses a text file and returns the list of dictionaries with information about each cat.


### 2) Development of console applications with a cli
* Task3: Develop a script that accepts a directory path as a command line argument and visualizes the structure of that directory, outputting the names of all subdirectories and files. For better visual perception, the names of directories and files should differ in color.
* Task4: Write a console assistant bot that will recognize commands entered from the keyboard and respond according to the entered command.
